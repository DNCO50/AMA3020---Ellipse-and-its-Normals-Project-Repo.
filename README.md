The 3 main code files for the Ellipse and its Normals project used to generate the images and results are:

AMAellipseplot.py - used for the main plot of the ellipse and the hyperbola
EvolutePlot.py - used to plot the evolute as well as the single hyperbola corresponding to a point on the evolute (Figure_3.png)
ellipse_hyperbola_intersection_solver.py - Used scipy fsolve to solve for the intersection between the ellipse and the hyperbola for a given point
